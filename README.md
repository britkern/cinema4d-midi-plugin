# Cinema4d MIDI Plugin

Yellow! This repository contains a very simple (OSX-specifc) implementation of a bridge between the MIDI interface and Cinema4D presented as a Plugin.

# The plugin
It will expose two values from the very first MIDI device it finds: **note** and **value**.

From there you can wire it up using XPresso.
